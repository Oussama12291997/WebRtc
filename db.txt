my personal low-budget hair routine for curly hair :

1] pre hair wash : I used to use garnier's banana hair mask (1300-1500da) it was a life saver, but it's boycotted now. so I make my own hair mask by mixing any oils I have with egg yolk (and I occasionally add a quarter of a banana, I have shorter hair)

I also use oils for hair growth (rn I use a remedy from the brand "Biohair" for 1200d. i got it just a few days ago. But kale, olive oil, garlic, and onion water work perfectly, too)

2] In the shower : I use the sunsilk shampoo (350da), the white bottle, it's a coconut oil one, I think. I shampoo it twice, and then I don't use a conditioner. I use a fluxCare hair mask (400da) in the yellow box. and I leave it in for the rest of the shower (10-15 minutes) and wash it off

I always make sure to do my last rinse with cold water. It makes my hair less frizzy for some reason

3] Right after the shower : I use an old shirt instead of a towel to dry my hair then I brush my hair when it's half dry. then I use byphase curling mousse (800da) and heat protection (400da) and dry my hair and diffuse it

make sure to sleep in a scarf, avoid putting it in a bun because it'll get tangled, I do two braids. avoid tiny hair ties and throughout the week, I have a bottle of water with a tiny bit of the flux hair mask that I spray on when my hair feels dry
